Absolutely horrendous code that generate gibberish haikus following the 5-7-5 form, and then translate them using some online translate.

These haikus make no sense in japanese, although they respect the superficial poetic form. It is the translator which infuses them with meaning, by earnestly trying to convey their content in english, in a valid and coherent fashion, although no coherent content is present in the first place. You might understand these as wholly english works inspired by complete misunderstanding and straightforward misdirection. Indeed, translation is art.
